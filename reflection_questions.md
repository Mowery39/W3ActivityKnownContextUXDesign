# Reflection Questions 

## Briefly describe your approach to this activity

- My approach was to first figure out what map I wanted to use. I decided to just pick the one that was suggested in the Canvas instructions. After that, I just kind of separated the eras of universities and how everything has changed over the years. 

## User Needs: Pains, Gains, and Jobs 

- Who are the users that interact with the university system?
-- The main users are students, faculty, and administrative staff, with students being the most frequent users. Each group interacts with the system differently but relies on it to get through daily academic tasks.
- What tasks or objectives are the users attempting to complete (jobs)? 

- What benefit or need do users get from the university system (gains)?

- What discomfort or difficulty do users need to accept when interacting with the university system (pains)?
