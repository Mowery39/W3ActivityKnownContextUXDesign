This project applies UX design methods to analyze how U.S. universities have evolved over time, using an Eras Map to highlight major shifts in structure, technology, and user experience. The goal was to understand how long-term changes have shaped modern university systems and how design decisions impact students, faculty, and administrators.

The project emphasizes clear communication, user-centered thinking, and structured analysis rather than visual complexity.
