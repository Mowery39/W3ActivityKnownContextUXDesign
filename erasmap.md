# Design Artifact (Eras Map)

## What is an Eras Map?

An Eras Map is a way to break down how a system evolves by grouping major changes into clear phases. It focuses on big shifts rather than small details, which makes it easier to see patterns and understand why things work the way they do today.

### Era 1: Campus-First Universities (Pre-2000)

- Everything revolved around being physically on campus
- Classes, advising, registration, and resources all required showing up
- Paper forms and in-person communication were the norm
- Degree paths were structured and not very flexible
- How it felt: If you weren’t on campus, you were basically out of the loop.

### Era 2: “We Have Email Now” Universities (2000–2010)

- Email became the main way schools communicated with students
- Early learning platforms started popping up
- Online registration and portals were introduced
- Classes were still almost entirely in person
- How it felt: Technology existed, but it was more of a convenience than a necessity.

### Era 3: Portal-Driven & Hybrid Universities (2010–2020)

- Centralized systems like Canvas became unavoidable
- Hybrid and online classes started to feel normal
- Most student tasks moved online instead of to physical offices
- Students interacted more with systems than with people
- How it felt: The university stopped being just a place and started acting like a platform.

### Era 4: Flexibility-First & AI-Influenced Universities (2020–Present)

- Remote and asynchronous learning became fully accepted
- Automation and AI tools started supporting both students and faculty
- More emphasis on accessibility and flexible schedules
- Education began adapting to students’ lives instead of the opposite
- How it felt: The system finally started bending around the user.
