# Design Artifact (Eras Map)

## What is an Eras Map?

An Eras Map is a way to break down how a system evolves by grouping major changes into clear phases. It focuses on big shifts rather than small details, which makes it easier to see patterns and understand why things work the way they do today.

### Era 1: Campus-First Universities (Pre-2000)

- Everything revolved around being physically on campus
- Classes, advising, registration, and resources all required showing up
- Paper forms and in-person communication were the norm
- Degree paths were structured and not very flexible

How it felt: If you weren’t on campus, you were basically out of the loop.
